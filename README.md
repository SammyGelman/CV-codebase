Hello, if you are reading this you are most likely a prospective employeer looking to know more about the code I've written in the past.

This is a random assortment of code I've written over the last couple of years. 

The repository is broken up into a few directories. This includes the main languages I've written in: Python and Julia was used for the research I have been conducting and C++ was learnt as a way to practive writing in a strongly typed language. 

There are two other small projects included. Simply haiku is realated to a twitter account I have where I write haiku. 
The idea was to use the text from the poems I had written and use them as the input for a text-to-image software. 
This was done before DALLE-2 stepped into the scene and used a (in my humble opion and no judgement) slightly worse open source algorithm call VQGAN.
